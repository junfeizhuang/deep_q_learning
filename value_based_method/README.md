# simple_deep_q_learning
A simple example to learn deep q learning implemenation in pytorch.  
The environment is [CartPole-v1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/)
Change `Config.py` to support DQN, Double DQN and Dueling DQN
Run `run_this.py` to get results
Results are recorded every 50 epoch. They are as below
